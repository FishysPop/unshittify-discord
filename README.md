A personal project to fix the design mistakes and disalignments in the Discord app.
If it's unreadable, it's by design, I didn't want you to steal my secret sauce.

**Disclaimer:** This is a discord unoficcial theme, it is not affiliated with Discord in any way.
If you are discord and wish for this to be taken down, please message me at hello@nak.kiwi

## Features

- Removed top bar and left it floating. The window can still be moved by nearing the mouse to the top of the window.

## Settings

If using [Installation](#installation) methods 1 or 4, you can change the following settings by opening the theme.css file in a text editor:

```css
/* SETTINGS */
:root {
	/* Right padding of the top bar */
	--top-bar-padding: 220px;
	/* Icon scale */
	--icon-scale: 1;

	/* NSPG911 Refreshed Seamless Chat Bar */
	/* Custom padding for the chat box */
	--rscb-chat-box-padding: 8px;
	/* Whether you want the chat to not move up and down when someone starts typing */
	--rscb-no-jump-chat: 0;
}
```

- `--top-bar-padding`: The right padding of the top bar. This is the space between the top bar and the right side of the window. Default is `220px`. You needn't change this unless you modified the top bar width, perhaps by removing some icons.
- `--icon-scale`: The scale of the icons. Default is `1`. You can set this to any value you want, but I recommend keeping it between `1` and `1.3`.
- `--rscb-chat-box-padding`: The padding of the "user is typing" box. Default is `8px`.
- `--rscb-no-jump-chat`: Whether you want the chat to not move up and down when someone starts typing. Default is `0` (disabled). Set it to `1` to enable it.

## Known Issues

- The drag icon may fail to register events at some window sizes.
